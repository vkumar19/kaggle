The bike sharing challenge on Kaggle is a good problem for beginners who are looking to 
practice their machine learning skills. The Kaggle forum provides excellent discussions on how to perform feature engineering and fit a model using R or Pandas. The part I found missing or partially covered on the forum is how to 1) start off a problem, 2) decide which features to use in the model, and 3) choose a given algorithm over the others. This step comes naturally to the people in the field but is not so obvious for someone coming from a different background like myself.I thought it will be great to share my experiences on the topic and get comments/suggestions from other kagglers.  

In general before jumping to the problem it is good to go over few scientific papers on the topic.You can aid your understanding of the data and save your time looking for trends and deciding on choosing a model by referrring to papers (if available) who have studied similar datasets in the past. For example, for the bike rental challenge kaggle lists the original paper by Hadi Fanaee-T and Joao Gama who utilized this dataset in their study though for a different purpose.This paper cites two more papers [ref 9, 51] which are extermely useful.       
After having a sense of what people found in their studies you can go ahead and look for similar trends in your data. Performing quick and dirty analysis of the training data in the early stages of the problem solving is extermely useful for feature engineering and for further improving your scores after you already have a good working model.I share with you two plots which provides a great deal of information about the bike rentals.
